# Matthew Musgrave Homework 1

## Overview and Origin of **Stripe**

* <ins>Company Name</ins>: Stripe

* <ins>Date Incorporated</ins>: Stripe was incorporated in 2011

* <ins>Company Founders</ins>: The company was founded by Patrick and John Collison

* In early 2010 John and Patrick began working on Stripe. As they were developing an idea they debated why it was so difficult to
make purchases online and through the web. As they began to explore this idea and devlop a prototype, they eventually had their first
transaction which legitimized their idea propelled their growth and development.

* The company is primarily funded through outside investment. Notably, General Catalyst, GV and Andreessen Horowitz to name a few.
So far, Stripe has raised $1.6 billion in total funding.

## <ins>Business Activities</ins>

* Stripe is solving the problem of online payments by bringing together everything that’s required to build websites and apps that accept payments and send payouts globally. 
Stripe’s products power payments for online and in-person retailers, subscriptions businesses, software platforms and marketplaces, and everything in between. Stripe also
helps companies by building in fraud protection, invoicing, financing and business management into their suite of product offerings.

* Stripe's intended customer base is any organization, large or small, that are looking for online payment solutions. The payments market is expected to reach $2 Trillion by 2025.
Their competitive advantage comes from their favorable fee structure as well as their focus on data security which is an increasingly prevalent area of concern in the payments space.

* Stripe is utilizing Ruby, NSQ and Apache Impala for their application and data infrastructure. For their DevOps the are employing CirclCI and PagerDuty. As for their business tools,
they are using G Suite, Asana, Zendesk, HackPad, Respondly, Clara Labs and Pagerbot.

## <ins>Business Landscape</ins>

* Stripe is operating within the payments and data security space for e-commerce, B2B payments and C2B payments.

* The major trends and innovations that have taken place in this industry is the expansion and availabilty of payments particularly in the c2c space. Also, money transfers and wires have
increasingly been shifting toward digital which is further pushing check and manual payments into obsolescence.

* Major companies in this domain include: Paypal, FIS, Major Financial institutions such as Bank Of America and JP Morgan, Square and Visa to name a few.

## <ins>Company Results/Impact</ins>

* Some of the business impacts that Stripe has had so far is that they employ 2,500+ employees across 14 global offices that support millions of Stripe users. Also, Stripe currently has ~18% market share of dollars in the digital payments market, second only to Paypal.

* The primary metric of success, since there are so many competitors, is market share. As stated above, Stripe currently holds 18% of the market share of the digital payments space. It's impressive that Stripe has been able to grow so rapidly considering they were incorporated only 9 years ago.

## <ins>Recommendations</ins>

* I would recommend that Stripe continue to break into different types of payment platforms including mobile and C2C as those are growing methods for making payments and transacting in today's marketplace. Established financial institutions are developing their own capabilities in the C2C space through the Zelle platform. In order to break into this market, Stipe should consider hiring developers who can build mobile apps as well as employing mobile risk managers who understand the evolving mobile and C2C payment landscape.
